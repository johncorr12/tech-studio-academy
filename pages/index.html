                I came into Tech Studio Academy with practically no prior
                knowledge in software development. However, within a few weeks,
                I was able to grasp the crux of software development and also
                master the soft skills required for being a software developer.
              </p>
              <p>
                So far so good, the skills acquired have given me a mind-blowing
                push in my career as a software developer.

                Tech Studio Academy has been one of the big push I needed to get
                in the real world space. I had an immense learning that was
                really different from the self learning I started with. The
                learning was fun and there were some internship job
                opportunities that were presented to us. I got my first gig
                immediately after the program.
              </p>
              <p>Thank you Tech Studio for that push I needed.</p>

                  Why Is This Course Relevant Today?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  There's never been a better time to start a career as a web developer because there is a consistent demand for developers who both write high-quality code and experienced problem solvers who can design creative solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The web and the applications built for it have transformed the way we do business globally, and is disrupting industries from education to manufacturing.
                </p>
 
                <h3>  
                  What Practical Skill Sets Can I Expect To Have Upon Completion Of The Course?
                </h3>
                <p class="skills">
                  By the end of the course, you will have gained practice in the most used web-based programming language â€“ JavaScript. Youâ€™ll have built several full-stack applications of varying complexity, and have experience working with a team in a development environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Youâ€™ll gain confidence in tackling new technologies in an ever-changing field. Youâ€™ll have gained foundational skill in many disciplines that touch web development â€“ managing complex data sets, securing your applications with encrypted passwords, and testing and deploying your applications to prepare them to scale.
                </p>

                <h3>
                  Should I Come Equipped With Anything?
                </h3>

                <p>
                  Yes, a laptop is required (either Mac or PC) with a minimum of 4GB RAM with a storage capacity of at least 350GB. The course will walk you through installing the necessary free software.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At least, youâ€™ll require basic secondary school mathematics, but no previous programming language experience is required.
